# iNeed

iNeed is a platform being designed to help communication between partners, friends, and family. Everyone communicates differently and everyone has different needs. When it comes down to needing help and knowing how to ask for it, barriers in communication often mean people don't recieve the help they need. In response iNeed is a project that focuses on you customizing what would be helpful and unhelpful at a particular time and discreetly ask chosen individuals for help when you need it.
